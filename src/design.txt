- good logs
- r2: sqlite backup, db seed for testing

dark mode
save the zon and build zig locally on sqlite, then search later, update metadata

zigdir.org?
zigindex.org

is_package:
- "zig fetch" filename:readme.md

inspo
- https://github.com/leanprover/reservoir
- https://github.com/leanprover/reservoir-index

- https://api.github.com/repos/Cloudef/zig-aio/languages
  - use this to determine whether a thing is worth indexing?
- parse the b "thing" in build.zig and display it on site
- search for "zig fetch" in readmes..
- dependency graph for the zons
- "what c/cpp project builds with zig"
- the focus should 100% be on the build.zig and the zon files, not stars

design:
- the simplest mvp possible: newest zig packages!
- name not fixed in stone, use .org
- input: build.zig.zon and build.zig, output: htmls
- not registry, it's like golang
  - inspiration: pkg.go.dev, crates.io
- support github/gitlab/bitbucket/codeberg/srht
- autodoc for each pkg, i'll handle it for u (advanced, maybe)
- experiences:
  - 'i wonder whats the most popular pkg 7d'
  - 'whats the most popular pkg of all time'
  - 'does this pkg support zig version X'
  - 'what high-star repo uses zigs build system (eg. ggml)'
- since i dont have the raw download log, certain things arent possible
  - "most popular 7d" kind of stuff isn't possible

tech:
- bun js + templating lang + htmx?
- postgres? redis even? maybe sqlite?
- coolify + hetzner

how:
- keep track of all git repos

- looks like i would need to use pupeeteer

ways to index:
- repositories search
- commit search
- search zon files, and get the urls there
- manual indexing for edge cases
- code search should be last resort

notes on api:
- language: null, i check it's an actual zig project?
- some emtpy repos are returned to me and im like what
- false positives are OK? can filter on my end
